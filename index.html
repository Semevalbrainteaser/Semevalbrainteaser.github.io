    <h2 id ="motivation">Motivation</h2>
    <p>Human reasoning processes comprise two types of thinking: vertical and lateral. 
        Vertical thinking, also known as linear, convergent, or logical thinking, is a sequential analytical process that is based on rationality, logic, and rules.
        Meanwhile, lateral thinking (or “thinking outside the box”) is a divergent and creative process that involves looking at a problem from a new
        perspective and defying preconceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The success of language models has inspired
        the NLP community to attend to tasks that
        require implicit and complex reasoning, relying on human-like commonsense mechanisms.
        While such vertical thinking tasks have been
        relatively popular, lateral thinking puzzles have
        received little attention. To bridge this gap,
        we devise BRAINTEASER: a multiple-choice
        Question Answering task designed to test the
        model’s ability to exhibit lateral thinking and
        defy default commonsense associations.
    </p>

    <p>BRAINTEASER QA task consists of two subtasks-<strong>Sentence Puzzle</strong> and <strong>Word Puzzle</strong> 
        that require awareness of commonsense “defaults” and overwriting them through  unconventional thinking that distinguishes these defaults from hard constraints.
    </p>


    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sentence Puzzle</strong>: Sentence-type brain teaser where the puzzle defying commonsense is centered on sentence snippets. </li>
        <li><strong>Word Puzzle</strong>: Word-type brain teaser where the answer violates the default 
            meaning of the word and focuses on the letter composition of the target question</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both tasks include an adversarial subset, created by manually modifying the original brain teasers without changing their latent reasoning path.</p>

    <h2 id ="task-example">Task Example</h2>
    <p>Here are two examples from each subtasks</p>
    <table align="center">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Question</th>
                <th>Choice</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>

                    None of the above.<hr>

                    The letter O.<hr>

    <p>To ensure that our task evaluates reasoning ability rather than memorization, we construct adversarial versions of
        the original data in two ways: </p>
        
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Semantic Reconstruction</strong> rephrases the original question
    without changing the correct answer and the distractors.</li>
        <li> <strong>Context Reconstruction</strong> keeps the 
    original reasoning path but changes both the question and the answer to describe a new situational context. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are the example of two adversarial versions of Sentence Puzzle: </p>
    <table align="center">

    <p>Each system will be evaluated based on the following two accuracy metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Instance-based Accuracy</strong>: We considers each question (original/adversarial) as a separate instance. We will report accuracy for the original, and its adversarials.</li>
        <li> <strong>Group-based Accuracy</strong>: Each question and its associated adversarial instances form a group, and a system will only receive a score of 1 when it correctly solves all questions in the group.</li>
